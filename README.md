# A toolkit for designing and simulating Superconducting Nonlinear Asymmetric Inductive eLements for superconducting qubit experiments

This repository provides an integrated framework to desisgn SNAILs using qiskit metal, generate Ansys HFSS files automatically to simulate the designed devices classically, and then expanding on existing framework provided pyEPR to simualted additional correction terms necessary for the flux biasiing of SNAILs. The goal of this project is to automate and speed up the design-simulate-prep for fabrication cycle to test superconducting qubit devices.
